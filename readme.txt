Ask a bot to build Elementor widgets for you. See the changes in real time. Save your widgets and include them in any of your pages with the Elementor editor.

== Description ==

BIFM Widget Manager allows WordPress users to efficiently manage and view AI-generated widgets for Elementor. The plugin connects with Build It For Me's API to facilitate the generation and management of these widgets.

Features:
* **Just ask a bot**: The bot will build any front end widget you want. Ask for interactive widgets!
* **Add the widget to a page**: Save the widget, and use elementor's editor to drag the widget into your page.
* **Simple Management Interface**: Easily view and manage AI-generated widgets directly from your WordPress dashboard.



== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly, or upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/bifm-widget-manager` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the 'Build It For Me' menu in your dashboard to create and manage AI-generated widgets.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a new AI-generated widget? =
Navigate to 'Build It For Me' in your WordPress dashboard and click on the 'Create Widget' submenu to generate a new widget. Ask a bot to build the widget you want.
Start with something simple and you can continue asking the bot to do changes until you're pleased with the result.
If at some point you don't like what the bot did, use the UNDO button. It's better to not complicate your project too much.
Click 'Reset' to start over.

= Why is the bot not doing what I ask it to do? =
The UNDO button is your best friend. The bot can sometimes fail to understand what you're asking, try using the UNDO button and ask with different words.
If the button didn't do what you expected it's always best to use the UNDO button than to continue asking for changes.

= Is there a limit to how many widgets I can create? =
This might depend on your API limits with Build It For Me. Please refer to their official documentation for more details.

= How do I use a widget I created? =
Once you like the widget you've developed, hit 'Save', provide a name for your widget (it can't start with a number, can't contain special characters). Then you'll see the widget in your website under the name you saved it with.

= How do I restart from scratch? =
In the 'Create widget' page click 'Reset' to start over.

= Can I edit a widget? =
You can iteratively work on your widget by asking the bot to do changes to it. But once you hit the reset button to create a new widget, you can't go back to edit an old widget.

= Who can use the plugin? =
Your wordpress users with editor permissions and higher.

= How can I get help? =
We appreciate any feedback at pablo@builditforme.ai
